#+title: The Amputator

The amputator is a kindling preparing device cobbled from a old circular saw, MDF
and a old saw table stand. It was deemed saver to make this than the hand-held
circular saw I used before to prepare kindling, if you can believe that.

Its used to cut garden branches and sticks to length so they fit my wood stove.

The amputator ready to amputate, and perhaps chop some kindling. Branches are
fed against the spin, as you'd expect.
